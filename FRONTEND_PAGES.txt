# InsightX Frontend Pages Overview

This document outlines the purpose and visual interface of each primary page in the InsightX application. All descriptions are strictly limited to frontend UI elements, layouts, and user interactions.

## 1. Landing Page (`/`)
- **Purpose**: The gateway to the application.
- **UI Components**: Contains a large hero section, value propositions, and primary call-to-action buttons directing users to start their journey or log in. It avoids the persistent navigation bar for a cleaner entry experience.

## 2. Login Page (`/login`)
- **Purpose**: User authentication interface.
- **UI Components**: Clean, centered form layout with input fields for user credentials and buttons for submitting or switching auth modes. Contains minimal distractions.

## 3. Connect Page (`/connect`)
- **Purpose**: The bridge for users to bring in their data.
- **UI Components**: A visually elevated card interface offering three segmented tabs: Upload CSV (drag-and-drop zone), Database Connection (input form), and Sample Data. Features sleek scanning animations and a Data DNA preview step once data is mocked or uploaded.

## 4. Workspace Index (`/workspace`)
- **Purpose**: The loading and routing entry point for active analysis.
- **UI Components**: Displays a centered, pulsing "Initializing Workspace..." loading state before transitioning the user to their specific session interface.

## 5. Active Workspace (`/workspace/[id]`)
- **Purpose**: The core interactive data analysis environment.
- **UI Components**: A complex, multi-panel layout.
  - **Left/Center**: A conversational `ChatPanel` displaying user queries, streaming AI responses, and quick action chips. Includes a sticky chat input at the bottom.
  - **Right Sidebar**: An expandable side-rail featuring icons for Data DNA, SQL Executions, Python Executions, and Context. Opens into detailed panels showing data profile stats and execution logs.

## 6. Reports Page (`/reports`)
- **Purpose**: A visual dashboard for critical insights and trends.
- **UI Components**: Features a `ReportsHero`, a filter bar, and a grid of `InsightCards`. Each card visualizes metrics using Recharts (line or bar graphs), displaying trends (up/down signals) alongside categorical tags and a "Share Room" button.

## 7. Recents Page (`/recents`)
- **Purpose**: Historical log of past data sessions and chats.
- **UI Components**: A centralized list view of "Session Cards." Each card displays the dataset name, status, row count, and relative time. Cards can be expanded via a smooth chevron animation to reveal a nested, clickable list of chat histories for that specific dataset.

## 8. Contact Page (`/contact`)
- **Purpose**: A simple information page.
- **UI Components**: Contains basic typography (heading and subtitle) to provide users with contact details or a way to get in touch with the team.

*Note: The `GlobalHeader` persists across most internal pages (except Landing, Login, and Workspace), providing consistent navigation pills and seamless page routing.*
